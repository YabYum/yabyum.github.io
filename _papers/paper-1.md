title: 'Real-world insights into the efficacy and safety of tyrosine kinase inhibitors against thyroid cancers'
collection: papers
permalink: /papers/paper-1
excerpt: 'Based on clinical trials demonstrating favorable short-term efficacy and tolerable toxicity, several tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been approved for treating locally recurrent or metastatic, progressive radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer, BRAFV600E-mutant anaplastic thyroid cancer, and advanced or progressive medullary thyroid cancer. Longer term efficacy and safety of these treatments have been investigated in multiple real-world studies, demonstrating indispensable complementary value. Hereby, we summarize data from a total of 27 real-world studies with a focus on long-term survival data and rare but life-threatening adverse effects. An overall picture of current real-world study was drawn, and integrated experience of multiple centers would be helpful to clinical practice and further research.'

Based on clinical trials demonstrating favorable short-term efficacy and tolerable toxicity, several tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been approved for treating locally recurrent or metastatic, progressive radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer, BRAFV600E-mutant anaplastic thyroid cancer, and advanced or progressive medullary thyroid cancer. Longer term efficacy and safety of these treatments have been investigated in multiple real-world studies, demonstrating indispensable complementary value. Hereby, we summarize data from a total of 27 real-world studies with a focus on long-term survival data and rare but life-threatening adverse effects. An overall picture of current real-world study was drawn, and integrated experience of multiple centers would be helpful to clinical practice and further research.
