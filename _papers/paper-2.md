collection: papers

excerpt: 'We summarize predictive coding models of embodiment, co-occurrence of over- and under-weighting priors, subjective time processing, language production or comprehension, self-or-other inference, and social interaction. Corresponding impairments and clinical manifestations of schizophrenia are reviewed under these models at the same time. Finally, we discuss why and how to inaugurate a therapy turn of further research under the framework of predictive coding.'

We summarize predictive coding models of embodiment, co-occurrence of over- and under-weighting priors, subjective time processing, language production or comprehension, self-or-other inference, and social interaction. Corresponding impairments and clinical manifestations of schizophrenia are reviewed under these models at the same time. Finally, we discuss why and how to inaugurate a therapy turn of further research under the framework of predictive coding.
