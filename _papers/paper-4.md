title: 'Enabling self-identification in intelligent agent: insights from computational psychoanalysis'
collection: papers
permalink: /papers/paper-4
#excerpt: 'Building upon prior framework of computational Lacanian psychoanalysis with the theory of active inference, this paper aims to further explore the concept of self-identification and its potential applications. Beginning with two classic paradigms in psychology, mirror self-recognition and rubber hand illusion, we suggest that imaginary identification is characterized by an integrated body schema with minimal free energy. Next, we briefly survey three dimensions of symbolic identification (sociological, psychoanalytic, and linguistical) and corresponding active inference accounts. To provide intuition, we respectively employ a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) supervised by ChatGPT to showcase optimization of free energy during motor skill and language mastery underlying identification formation. We then introduce Lacan's Graph II of desire, unifying imaginary and symbolic identification, and propose an illustrative model called FreeAgent. In concluding remarks, we discuss some key issues in the potential of computational Lacanian psychoanalysis to advance mental health and artificial intelligence, including digital twin mind, large language models as avatars of the Lacanian Other, and the feasibility of human-level artificial general intelligence with self-awareness in the context of post-structuralism.'
