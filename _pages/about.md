Overview
======
I am currently pursuing a degree in psychiatry at at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University][sjtu] & [Shanghai Mental Health Center][smhc], while also interning at [Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory][shailab].

My passion lies in exploring every facet of the human mind through computational modeling, [active inference][fep], artificial intelligence, and philosophy. I'm particularly intrigued by the following questions:

* How do we utilize internal models to comprehend and engage with the external world?
* How do we derive our unique identities from bodily experiences and social contexts?
* How can we develop a digital twin mind capable of self-identification?


My current projects
======
At Shanghai Mental Health Center, I am working on modeling Lacanian philosophy of human subjectivity using active inference. I apply this framework to study the psychopathology of mental disorders like suicidal ideation.

At Shanghai AI Lab, I am investigating the theory and techniques related to large language model safety. My work involves reflecting on the origins and definition of LLM risks. Concurrently, my colleagues and I are working to advance LLM safety, including developing benchmarks and improving model architectures.
