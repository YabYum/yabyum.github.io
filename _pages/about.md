I am currently majoring in psychiatry at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) & [Shanghai Mental Health Center](https://www.smhc.org.cn/English/), and doing an internship at [Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory](https://www.shlab.org.cn/). 

My research interests lie in computational modeling, active inference, philosophy, and large languge models. 

In Shanghai Mental Health Center, I aim to model Lacanian philosophy of human subjectivity using active inference, and hence explore digital twin mind at the macro level. 

In Shanghai AI Lab, I am investigating theory and techniques of large language models' safety. I reflect the origins and definition of LLMs risks based on philosophy of science, sociology, and psychology. At the same time, my collegues and I work to advance LLMs safety including benchmarks and model architecture.
