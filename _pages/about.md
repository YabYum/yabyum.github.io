I am currently majoring in psychiatry at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University][sjtu] & [Shanghai Mental Health Center][smhc], and doing an internship at [Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory][shailab]. 

My research interests lie in computational modeling, active inference, philosophy, and large languge models. 

In Shanghai Mental Health Center, I aim to model Lacanian philosophy of human subjectivity using [active inference][fep], and hence explore digital twin mind at the macro level. 

In Shanghai AI Lab, I am investigating theory and techniques of large language models' safety. I reflect the origins and definition of LLMs risks based on philosophy of science, sociology, and psychology. At the same time, my collegues and I work to advance LLMs safety including benchmarks and model architecture.
