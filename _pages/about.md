Welcome to my website! I am Lingyu Li （李凌宇）. I am currently majoring in psychiatry at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), and doing my internship at [Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory](https://www.shlab.org.cn/). My research interests lie in computational modeling, cognitive science, philosophy of science, and large languge models.
